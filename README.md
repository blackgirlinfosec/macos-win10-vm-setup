# ðŸ§ª Installing VirtualBox & Creating a Windows 10 VM on macOS

This lab documents the process of setting up a Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) using VirtualBox on macOS. This environment will serve as a foundation for future cybersecurity labs, such as Kerberos authentication and endpoint testing.

## ðŸ§° Tools Used

- macOS (host machine)
- VirtualBox
- Windows 10 ISO
- VirtualBox Guest Additions

## ðŸ§  Why This Matters

Cybersecurity professionals often need safe, isolated environments to test security tools, perform system triage, and simulate attacks. Building a lab using VirtualBox on macOS proves resourcefulness and platform flexibility.

## âœ… Steps Overview

### Step 1: Why Use VirtualBox on macOS?

VirtualBox gives you a safe, cost free environment to test Windows-based tools without touching your actual machine. Perfect for lab work on a Mac.

### Step 3: Creating the VM

- VM Name: `Win10-KerberosClient`  
- OS: Windows 10 (64-bit)  
- RAM: 3072 MB  
- Disk: 50 GB (VDI, dynamically allocated)

- [006 - Disk size](./006-vm-hard-disk-settings.png)
- [007 - Disk format](./007-vdi-dynamic-disk.png)

---

### Step 4: Mounting the Windows 10 ISO

Used the official Microsoft ISO and attached it under Storage settings in VirtualBox.

### Step 5: Installing Windows 10

Followed setup prompts, skipped Microsoft sign-in, created local user `KerberosClient`, and disabled privacy settings for better lab control.

### Step 6: Installing Guest Additions

Inserted Guest Additions CD, ran the installer, and rebooted the VM for improved screen resolution and usability.

### Step 7: Creating a Snapshot

Took a snapshot of the clean install state for future rollback.  
Snapshot name: **Clean Install - Guest Additions Installed**

## ðŸ§  Reflection

Setting up this VM gives me a reliable Windows 10 environment to run cybersecurity labs from my Mac. With snapshots, I can safely simulate attacks, test defenses, and break things without risk.
